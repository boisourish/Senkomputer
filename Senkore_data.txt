Senkore
A virtual CPU core capable of basic mathematics, 20 col text and basic pixel rendering using a custom instruction set.

The default configuration has 16 bytes of cache, 8 used for instructions and the other 8 for storing values. The accumulator consists of 
2 bytes of memory and is able to store a number up to 65536. The implemented ALU can't use the carry part of the accumulator, if it's invoked
it'll use the last 8 bits of the accumulator and the current value cache space determined by the counter.

Every instruction is supposed to be paired to its own value (or not, depending on the instruction), so treat "this" as the current value read.
ACC = normal accumulator value
CarryACC = carry accumulator value
(R) reserved for future implementation

Instruction List:
- memory manipulation -
0 : skip this clock.
1 : (R) skip this clock.
2 : clear this cache value slot.
3 : save the current ACC to this value slot.
4 : store this value to ACC.
5 : save the current CarryACC to this value slot.
6 : store this value to CarryACC.
7 : jump to this instruction.
8 : jump to this instruction if ACC == 1. 
- ALU -
